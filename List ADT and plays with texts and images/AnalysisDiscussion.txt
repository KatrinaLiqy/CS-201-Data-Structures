After examining the data, we found out several connections between the information. For example, the top 10 contries
that have the least access to electricity also have very little CO2 emissions per capita, and the top 10 countries 
that have the most annual population growth (generally) also have the most annual urban population growth.

We pulled down the top 10 countries with highest CO2 emissions and compared them with total greenhouse gas emissions.
And we are surprised that unlike other countries, United States and North America had significantly higher greenhouse
gas emissions than other countries. We hypothesized that there are huge number of Industries and Factories that releases
greenhouse gases other than CO2. This is the same as with Australia.

We are also surprised that Urban population growth is generally not related to the Access to electricity. 

We would like to investigate the relationship between population and its growth because the countries with more population
also have more population growth and this is opposite to what we expected.
